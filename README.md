# Pantry helps you find dishes that you can make with the ingredients you have on hand.

Pantry is a Rails app that started out as a group project built for a class assignment. I co-wrote the JavaScript and UI for all interactive features on the home page. I also wrote the seed files, developed the model logic, and developed the result view. I did the vast majority of front-end design for this site (color scheme, etc). The Devise setup was done by another group member. Drafting ERDs and setting up routes and controllers were team efforts.

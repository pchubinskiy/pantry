        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p>Pantry.io is very easy to use. All you have to do is sign up. Once you log in, select a category from the drop down menu and you will see a list of ingredients. Choose the ingredients you want and submit them to the cart. All your ingredients will be shown in the cart. You may go ahead and choose other ingredients from another category and submit those. Once your cart is ready, submit it--a list of recipes with your ingredients in them will appear.</p>
